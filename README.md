# Getting and cleaning Data Project

This is a project for the class of getting and cleaning data of coursera.

To make the correct use of the script *run_analysis* you must download the data set, and locate it to an upper level of where the script is or you can only modify the `fileLocation` variable.

When all the files are in place, the only thing to do is *Run* the script.

All the files from _test_ and _train_ are read, so the main dataset can be constructed.

The result of this project is written over a file called `resultData.txt`
